Hub for distributing Stripflow
This site makes available files needed for running Stripflow. If you have questions, please contact me baskin at bio dot umass dot edu.
If you publish results obtained with Stripflow, please cite Yang et al. 2016.
There are three groups of files:
1: The MATLAB code files.
2: Testfiles, containing examples that can be used to make sure the program runs properly.
3: Information files, including a read-me providing instructions and a 'principles' document explaining the underlying image analysis.
Each group of files is provied as a .zip archive.
